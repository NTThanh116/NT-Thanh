Hi there!



This is **NT Thanh**, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology (Bach Khoa University - HCMUT).



Currently, my research mainly focuses on numerical simulations and mathematical modelling in Engineering Physics.



* Computational mechanics;
* Composite structures;
* Thermal-mechanical fatigue (Low-circle fatigue)
* Numerical method (FEM, Meshfree);
* Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs);
* Artificial neural network (ANN);



%%% Softwares: Matlab / Python
